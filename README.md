# groceryListJS

In this exercise I generated a grocery shopping list by using JavaScript.

I removed excess duplicate elements from a grocery list array I created in order to create a numbered shopping list of unique items.

I used functions and array methods in JavaScript to remove the duplicates. I also used forEach() to generate a numbered list of items for the trip to the grocery store.
